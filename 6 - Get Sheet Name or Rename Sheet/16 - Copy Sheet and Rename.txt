This example is from our article on Copying Sheets.

After copying and pasting a Sheet, the newly created sheet becomes the ActiveSheet. So to rename a copied Sheet, simply use ActiveSheet.Name:

Sub CopySheetRename2()

    Sheets("Sheet1").Copy After:=Sheets(Sheets.Count)
    On Error Resume Next
    ActiveSheet.Name = "LastSheet"
    On Error GoTo 0

End Sub

Note: We added error handling to avoid errors if the Sheet name already exists.
