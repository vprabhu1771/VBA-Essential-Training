We will first see how to set properties of a Spin button in VBA and get a value in Worksheet. The code needs to be in event Change of the object spbSpinButton. You can enter this event by right-clicking on the Spin button and choosing View Code option. Here is the code:

Private Sub spbSpinButton_Change()

    Sheet1.spbSpinButton.Min = 100

    Sheet1.spbSpinButton.Max = 200

    Sheet1.spbSpinButton.SmallChange = 10

    Sheet1.Range("B2") = Sheet1.spbSpinButton.Value

End Sub


First, we set the lower limit for number range:

Sheet1.spbSpinButton.Min = 100


After that, we set the upper limit for number range:

Sheet1.spbSpinButton.Max = 200


We also need to set the step for number incrementation:

Sheet1.spbSpinButton.SmallChange = 10


Finally, we are assigning the current value of the Spin button to the cell B2. This value is in the Value attribute of the object Sheet1.spbSpinButton:

Sheet1.Range("B2") = Sheet1.spbSpinButton.Value


Now, whenever we click on the Spin button, the value will increase or decrease by 10 in the range 100-200:
