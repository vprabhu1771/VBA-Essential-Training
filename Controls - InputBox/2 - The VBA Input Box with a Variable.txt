We can declare a variable in our VBA code which then stores the information that is typed into the Input Box.  We can then use this variable in our code.

Depending on the type of information we want returned from the input box, we can declare a specific type of variable to either return text (a string or variant variable) or to return a number (an integer, long, double or single variable).
