The following code does three things:

1. Prompts for input with an InputBox and assigns it to a variable

2. Verifies input, otherwise exits the sub

3. Returns the input in a message box

Public Sub MyInputBox()

Dim MyInput As String
MyInput = InputBox("This is my InputBox", "MyInputTitle", "Enter your input text HERE")


If MyInput = "Enter your input text HERE" Or MyInput = "" Then
  Exit Sub
End If

MsgBox "The text from MyInputBox is " & MyInput

End Sub
