We can also return input data to an Excel Sheet using a variable.

Sub EnterNumber()

   On Error Resume Next

   Dim dblAmount As Double

   dblAmount = InputBox("Please enter the required amount", "Enter Amount")

   If dblAmount <> 0 Then
      Range("A1") = dblAmount
      MsgBox "Congrats"
   Else
      MsgBox "You did not enter a number!"
   End If

End Sub

In the example above, we are required to enter a number.  If we enter a number, then the variable dblAmount will put the number into the Excel sheet at cell A1.  However, if we do not enter a number, then a message box will tell us that we did not enter a number and nothing will be put into cell A1.
