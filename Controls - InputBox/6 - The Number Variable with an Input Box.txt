If you declare a number variable, you will need to enter a number only into the input box.

Public Sub MyInputBox()

Dim iInput As Integer

iInput = InputBox("Please enter a number", "Create Invoice Number", 1)

End Sub


First we declare the number variable as an integer variable.   We can then also put a default value of 1 in the input box.
