It looks like you are trying to read a text file with comma-separated values and populate the data into a worksheet using VBA. The error you are encountering, "User Defined type not defined," suggests that the necessary library or reference for the `FileSystemObject` is not enabled in your VBA environment.

Here's how you can fix this issue:

1. Open the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) editor by pressing `Alt + F11`.
2. In the VBA editor, go to "Tools" > "References."
3. In the "References" dialog, look for "Microsoft Scripting Runtime" and check it.

This reference is required for using the `FileSystemObject`. Checking it should resolve the "User Defined type not defined" error.

Here's an updated version of your code:

```vba
Sub ReadTextFileWithSeparators()
    Dim StrLine As String
    Dim FSO As Object
    Dim TSO As Object
    Dim StrLineElements As Variant
    Dim Index As Long
    Dim i As Long
    Dim Delimiter As String
    
    ' Create a FileSystemObject
    Set FSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    
    ' Open the text file
    Set TSO = FSO.OpenTextFile("C:\Test\TestFile.txt")
    
    Delimiter = ","
    Index = 1
    
    ' Loop through the lines of the text file
    Do While TSO.AtEndOfStream = False
        StrLine = TSO.ReadLine
        StrLineElements = Split(StrLine, Delimiter)
        
        ' Loop through the elements in the line and write to worksheet
        For i = LBound(StrLineElements) To UBound(StrLineElements)
            Cells(Index, i + 1).Value = StrLineElements(i)
        Next i
        
        Index = Index + 1
    Loop
    
    ' Close the text file
    TSO.Close
    
    ' Release the objects
    Set TSO = Nothing
    Set FSO = Nothing
End Sub
```

Make sure to enable the "Microsoft Scripting Runtime" reference as described above, and then try running the code again.
