Text in a text file is usually made up of several lines, separated by delimiters. These can be a comma (“,”), a comma with space (“, “), a semicolon (“;”), a  semicolon with space (“; “),  a space (“ “),  a tab (vbTab) or in rare cases any other character such as a tilde (~). The lines are normally separated by a line break (vbCRLF).

The easiest way to read a text file line by line into our Worksheet in VBA is to select the first cell where we want the text to be put, and then run the following code:

Sub ReadFile()

   Dim strFile As String, strLine As String

   strFile = "D:\color.txt"

   Open strFile For Input As #1

   Do Until EOF(1)
      Line Input #1, strLine
      ActiveCell = strLine
      ActiveCell.Offset(1, 0).Select
   Loop
   Close #1

End Sub

This will put each line of the text file into a single cell in Excel.
