The VBA input box works exactly the same way in Access as it does in Excel when returning user input in the form of a message box.

However, if you wish to return the user input to the database, you would need to use the Recordset object rather than the Range object as used in Excel.


Sub EnterInvoiceNumber()
   Dim dbs As Database
   Dim rst As Recordset
   Set dbs = CurrentDb
   Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset("tblMatters", dbOpenDynaset)
   With rst
      .AddNew
      !InvNo = InputBox("Please enter the Invoice Number", "INVOICE NUMBER GENERATION", 1)
      .Update
   End With
   rst.Close
   Set rst = Nothing
   Set dbs = Nothing
End Sub
